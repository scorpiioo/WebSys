		WEASLEY'S WIZARD WHEEZES </h3>
	</header>
	<p> 

Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, also known as Weasley & Weasley, is a joke shop located at Number 93 Diagon Alley founded by Fred and George Weasley.
The shop contains practical joke objects, such as Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes, and Fred and George's special WonderWitch 
products, such as; Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, and  Pygmy Puffs. There is also a section of Muggle Magic Tricks "for freaks like Dad",
 which are said to do steady business, despite not being big sellers. The shop also sells a number of defensive magical objects. This establishment
 started out as an 'owl-post service' led by the twins from the Burrow, (later continued from Hogwarts), selling joke-products until the final shop
 was opened.</p>

		<h3>
		WEASELY FAMILY CLOCK </h3>
	</header>
	<p> The Weasleys have a special clock in their home, the Burrow, with nine hands, one for every member of the family. Instead of telling the time,
	the clock reveals the location or status of each family member. The known locations are: Home, School, Work, Travelling, Lost, Hospital, Prison, 
	and Mortal Peril. The location Mortal Peril is situated where the 
	numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout the first five books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the
	sixth book all nine hands point to mortal peril at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with 
	Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as she does not know anyone else who has a clock like hers</p>
